<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>Green Crowd is a shopping utility application that aims to help consumers buy green on a budget.
By crowd sourcing the collection of pricing information,
Green Crowd can show shoppers exactly how much it will cost to shop at a given store.
With this, we hope to reward shoppers that are already buying green
and enable shoppers that previously abstained from buying sustainable goods due to prohibitivly high prices.
